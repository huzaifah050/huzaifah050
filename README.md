I am Huzaifah Yusif-Attah and I love to learn, code and teach.

My main technologies are Javascript, React <em> (Web and Mobile)</em> and Node, and I am currently working on a P2P money transfer solution as a final bootcamp project.

<h2 align="left"> I am currently on the look for developer roles. I am ready to learn which ever tech stack you use.</h2>

## Some Projects I have worked on
